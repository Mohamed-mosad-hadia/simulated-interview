# Interview Software

This software is designed to facilitate interviews by combining three key functionalities:

1. **Speech Recognition:** Converts spoken words into text.
2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Converts text into spoken audio.
3. **Simulated Interview:** Utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate interview questions and potentially analyze responses.

## How It Works

A chatbot serves as a mediator, guiding users through the interview process. The interview consists of ten questions:

1. **Introduction:** Users are asked to introduce themselves.
2. **Industry Specification:** Users specify their industry.
3. **Technical +IQ Question:** Users answer a technical question related to their industry.
4. **Dynamic Questions:** The remaining seven questions are dynamically generated by the GPT-3.5-turbo model using prompt engineering.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. download the library (pip install speech_recognition,openai, elevenlabs)
3. Follow the instructions provided by the chatbot to conduct an interview.
4. Please remember to include your (open_api) and (eleven_api).
